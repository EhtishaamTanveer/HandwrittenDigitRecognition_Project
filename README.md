# Handwritten Digit Recognition Task

This Github Repo contains a Multi-class classification task that focuses on recognizing handwritten digits.

Multi-class classification is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that assigns data points to one of **Multiple Predefined Classes**.

Ultimate aim of this task is to build a small neural network with few layers and a softmax ending layer that is able to predict the digits with high accuracy.

I have completed this task by myself while completing my Coursera specialization called [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NG3GPTVN7M8E?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=s12n)
